## TODO

- [ ] Add labels for spectral type distribution
- [x] Highlight y axes on mouseover
- [ ] URL encode all changes to graph state so you can share links
- [ ] Add drill down to show properly scaled dots for each asteroid in constellation. Should be a button on the right hand side.
- [ ] Add harmonics visual indicator
- [ ] Add scaled planet indicator. Maybe on the right side of the main graph?
- [ ] Listen to scroll wheel
- [ ] Add option to show spectral type on main graph
- [ ] Add icons for eccentricity, and inclination (rather than `e` and `i`)
- [ ] Add KM^2 to asteroid list
- [ ] Add close button for constellation
- [ ] Add filters for size, eccentricity, spectral type, name
